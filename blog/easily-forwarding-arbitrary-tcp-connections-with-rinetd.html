<h1 class="title">Easily forwarding arbitrary TCP connections with rinetd</h1>
<p>
In the past we've examined the use of firewall rules for forwarding incoming connections from one machine to another. But there is a simpler approach using the rinetd package. Read on to learn about this tool.
</p>

<p>
The rinetd package contains a simple tool which may be configured to listen for connections upon a machine, and silently redirect them to a new destination. In short it acts as a simple to configure TCP proxy.
</p>

<p>
You may install this package via :
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgc751e2e">
root@silver:~# apt-get update
root@silver:~# apt-get install rinetd
</pre>
<p>
(If you prefer you may use "aptitude update; aptitude install rinetd" - old habits die hard with me!)
</p>

<p>
Once installed you'll find a configuration file located at /etc/rinetd.conf. This file is used to tell the deamon which ports it should listen for connections upon, and what it should do when they arrive.
</p>

<p>
By default no ports are configured for forwarding, and so the file will consist entirely of comments. A default configuration file would look something like this, to give you an idea of the configuration:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgf19cc9c">
#
# forwarding rules come here
#
# you may specify allow and deny rules after a specific forwarding rule
# to apply to only that forwarding rule
#
# bindadress    bindport  connectaddress  connectport


# logging information
logfile /var/log/rinetd.log

# uncomment the following line if you want web-server style logfile format
# logcommon
</pre>
<p>
Note: There are more details about allowed options in the manpage which you may view by running "man rinetd".
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate how the forwarding is configured and used we'll make a simple example. Assume that you have a machine with the IP address 1.2.3.4 which has been running Apache, and that you'd like to move that to the IP address 4.3.2.1..
</p>

<p>
You've already updated DNS to point visitors to the new IP address, but you want to ensure that people connecting to the old IP still continue to receive service.
</p>

<p>
To handle this case you should update the /etc/rinetd.conf file to read:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgcc100b9">
# bindadress    bindport  connectaddress  connectport
1.2.3.4         80        4.3.2.1         80
1.2.3.4         443       4.3.2.1         443
</pre>
<p>
Once you restart rinetd all incoming connections on port 80 and 443 will be seamlessly redirected from the old IP to the new one - although you will need to restart rinetd after making the change to your configuration file:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org52db875">
root@silver:~# /etc/init.d/rinetd restart
Stopping internet redirection server: rinetd.
Starting internet redirection server: rinetd.
</pre>

<p>
rinetd is a very small, stable, and simple program, and you might find it simpler to understand than the matching generic iptables TCP proxy solution.
</p>

<p>
The only downside to using rinetd is that there is no support for UDP connections, and no support for redirecting FTP access - because of the complex nature of FTP.
